***An idle game written in HTML5***

Clempire lets you gather resources, build up your small empire (a little town...), improve your resource collecting and make progress through technologies and achievements.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The second command will create a `clempire.bundle.js` file wich is included in `index.html`.
