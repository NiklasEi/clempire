***An idle game with wood and stone***

Clempire lets you gather resources by clicking, build up your small empire (**cl**icking & **empire** :sweat:), improve your resource collecting and make progress through upgrades and achievements.

This game was created during one week as the front end project for an Ironhack course in full stack JS. It is live at [https://clempire.nikl.me](https://clempire.nikl.me). If anyone has an idea for a better name please tell me about it :P The same goes for funny upgrades/new buildings or anything else.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The second command will create a `clempire.bundle.js` file wich is included in `index.html`.

For continuos development let webpack watch the js files:
```bash
npm run watch
```
